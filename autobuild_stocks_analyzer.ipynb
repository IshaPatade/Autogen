Specifically, in `build()`, we prompt a LLM to create multiple participant agent and initialize a group chat, and specify whether this task need programming to solve. AgentBuilder also support open-source LLMs by [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/index.html) and [Fastchat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat). Check the supported model list [here](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/models/supported_models.html)."
